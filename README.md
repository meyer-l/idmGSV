======

The idmGSV is a web application to support the it baseline security riskmanagement standard. The application was developed during my master thesis " Implementation and evaluation of an IT Baseline Protection web application to improve IT structure analysis by (semi-)automatic processing of changes in information domains" at the University Bremen.
